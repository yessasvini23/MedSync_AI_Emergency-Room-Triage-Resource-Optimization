# 🚑 MedSync AI  
### AI-Powered Emergency Triage & Hospital Routing with Gemini

**MedSync AI** is an AI-assisted emergency coordination platform that helps paramedics and hospitals triage patients, assess risk, and route them to the most prepared hospital in real time — reducing ER overload, improving response time, and saving lives.

Built using **Google AI Studio + Gemini** as part of **Google Startup School: Prompt to Prototype** and submitted to the **Build the Future Showcase**.

---

## 🚨 Why MedSync AI Exists

Emergency departments are overwhelmed.  
Critical patients wait too long.  
Ambulances are sent to overloaded hospitals.  
Clinicians make life-or-death decisions without real-time system-wide insight.

MedSync AI was created to answer one urgent question:

> **What if emergency teams could see patient risk and hospital readiness at the same time?**

---

## 💡 What MedSync AI Does

MedSync AI provides **AI-assisted decision support** by:

- Assigning emergency **triage levels**
- Estimating **risk of deterioration**
- Recommending the **best hospital** based on capacity and specialists
- Triggering **time-critical alerts** for cardiac, stroke, and trauma cases
- Producing **clear, explainable outputs** for human review

The system is designed to **support medical professionals**, not replace them.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

MedSync AI is powered by a **Golden Prompt** built in **Google AI Studio**.

Gemini acts as a **virtual emergency coordinator**, reasoning across:
- Patient vitals and symptoms  
- Hospital capacity and specialists  
- Travel time and urgency  
- Safety and escalation rules  

All system logic lives inside the **prompt itself**, making the AI the core decision engine.

✨ What Makes MedSync AI Unique
Prompt-as-Logic Architecture — the system instruction is the application
Protocol-Aware Reasoning — safety rules embedded directly in the prompt
Explainable AI — every decision includes reasoning
Disaster-Ready — adapts to mass-casualty scenarios
No Fine-Tuning — built entirely with structured prompting

MedSync AI shows how prompt engineering can replace traditional backend logic for safety-critical systems.
